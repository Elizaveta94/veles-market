My diploma project: Veles-market. Java-based Project
Description:
The diploma project I have developed is a Java-based application that focuses on providing a platform for users to post and search classified ads. The main objective of the project is to facilitate the process of posting advertisements based on specific categories, as well as enabling users to search for ads using unique category identifiers. Additionally, the application allows users to edit their ads and personal information 
Key Features:
 1.User Registration: The application provides a user registration system, allowing individuals to create personal accounts and access the full functionality of the platform.
 2.Ad Submission: Users can submit their classified ads by specifying the relevant category and providing all the necessary details related to their advertisement.
 3.Categorization: The platform organizes ads based on different categories, making it easier for users to locate specific listings.
 4.Ad Search: Users can search for ads by utilizing the unique category identifiers, ensuring accurate and efficient results.
 5.Ad Editing: The application allows users to make modifications to their existing ads, enabling them to update information or remove listings if required.
 6.Personal Information Editing: Users have the option to edit their personal details within their profile, providing them with control over their displayed information.
 To develop my application, I used Spring Framework, Hibernate, Gradle, Rest API, JUnit tests, IntelliJ IDEA, Git, and others.
